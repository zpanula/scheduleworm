          Here's the thing. You said a "wyvern is a dragon." Is it in the same
          family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a 1k MMR feeder
          who studies dragons, I am telling you, specifically, in dota, no one
          calls wyverns dragons. If you want to be "specific" like you said,
          then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're
          saying "dragon family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of
          Varanidae, which includes things from wyverns to eldwurms to drakes.
          So your reasoning for calling a wyvern a dragon is because random
          people "call the flying lizards dragons?" Let's get gyarados and
          charizards in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a noob or a
          feeder? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works.
          They're both. A wyvern is a wyvern and a member of the dragon family.
          But that's not what you said. You said a wyvern is a dragon, which is
          not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the dragon
          family dragons, which means you'd call eldwurms, drakes, and other
          flying lizards dragons, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to
          just admit you're wrong, you know?
